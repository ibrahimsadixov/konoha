                        Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the
                        story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of
                        becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts: the first is
                        set
                        in Naruto's pre-teen years (volumes 1–27), and the second in his teens (volumes 28–72). The
                        series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto
                        an
                        honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto
                        (1997).

                        Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from September
                        1999
                        to November 2014, with its chapters collected in 72 tankōbon volumes. Part I of the manga
                        was
                        adapted into an anime television series by Pierrot and Aniplex, which ran for 220 episodes
                        from
                        October 2002 to February 2007 on TV Tokyo; the English dub of the series aired on Cartoon
                        Network and YTV from September 2005 to December 2009. A second series, which adapts material
                        from Part II of the manga, is titled Naruto: Shippuden and ran on TV Tokyo for 500 episodes
                        from
                        February 2007 to March 2017. The English dub of Shippuden was broadcast on Disney XD in the
                        United States from October 2009 to November 2011, airing the first 98 episodes before
                        eventually
                        switching over to Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in January 2014, starting over from
                        the
                        first episode. After Disney XD removed the series from broadcast, Viz Media began streaming
                        new
                        English dubbed episodes on their streaming service Neon Alley in from December 2012 to March
                        2016, starting at episode 99 and ending at episode 338 due to the service's shutdown.
                        Besides
                        the anime television series, Pierrot also developed 11 animated films and 12 original video
                        animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related merchandise includes light novels, video games, and
                        trading cards developed by several companies.

                        Viz Media licensed the manga and anime for North American production and serialized Naruto
                        in
                        their digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. The anime series began airing in the United
                        States
                        and Canada in 2005, and in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2006 and 2007, respectively.
                        The
                        films and most OVAs from the series were also released by Viz, with the first film
                        premiering in
                        movie theaters. The story of Naruto continues with Naruto's son, Boruto Uzumaki, in Boruto:
                        Naruto Next Generations: Boruto wishes to create his own ninja way instead of following his
                        father's.

                        Naruto is one of the best-selling manga series of all time, having 250 million copies in
                        circulation worldwide in 47 countries and regions, with 153 million copies in Japan alone
                        and
                        remaining 97 million copies elsewhere. It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga
                        series; their English translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The New
                        York
                        Times bestseller list several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006.
                        Reviewers
                        praised the manga's character development, storylines, and action sequences, though some
                        felt
                        the latter slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, which has a coming-of-age
                        theme,
                        makes use of cultural references from Japanese mythology and Confucianism.
